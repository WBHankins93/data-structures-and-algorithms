# Data Structures in Python: Array

An **array** is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow fast access to elements via an index, making them efficient for read and write operations.

## Array Operations

The `array.py` file demonstrates the following operations:

1. **Access** - Retrieve an element at a specific index.
2. **Modify** - Update an element at a specific index.
3. **Append** - Add an element to the end of the array.
4. **Insert** - Add an element at a specific index.
5. **Remove** - Remove the first occurrence of an element by value.
6. **Pop** - Remove an element at a specific index.

Each function in `array.py` is self-contained and can be called independently to perform the respective operation.

To run the examples, execute:

```bash
python array.py
