# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a comprehensive guide to learning and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms in multiple programming languages. It is designed as a collaborative, evolving resource, with an initial focus on Python.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a clear, multi-language reference for data structures and algorithms. Each language section will cover essential concepts, providing theory, code examples, and problem sets to reinforce learning.

## Current Structure

### Languages

The repository is organized by programming language, with each language-specific folder containing details on both data structures and algorithms.

- **Python**: The initial focus. The `Python` folder contains subdirectories for data structures and algorithms, each with explanations, code samples, and example problems.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

Each language section will cover the following key topics:

#### Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Set
- Map
- Binary Tree
- Heap
- Graph
- Trie (and potentially more)

#### Algorithms
- Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## Roadmap

1. **Python** - Currently in progress. This folder contains detailed resources, implementations, and problem sets in Python.
2. **JavaScript** - Planned. Will include data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.
3. **TypeScript** - Planned. Aims to provide TypeScript versions of all data structures and algorithms.
4. **Go** - Planned. Go implementations will be added for high-performance applications.
5. **C++** - Planned. C++ implementations will be added to explore efficiency in a low-level language.

### Tips as You Continue

- **Add Each Data Structure Gradually**: As you implement each data structure, add its respective `.py` file, and update the main `README.md` in `data_structures`.
- **Document Operations**: For each data structure, document the key operations supported (like push, pop for Stack) and add them to the corresponding `.py` file.
- **Provide Example Usage**: For each data structure, include example usage in the `README.md` to show how the code can be run interactively.

Let me know if you’d like to move forward with a specific data structure next!
